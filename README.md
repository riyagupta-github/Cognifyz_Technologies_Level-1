## Overview:<br>
This project explores a dataset of restaurants, focusing on data exploration, descriptive analysis, and geospatial visualization. The analysis covers a variety of aspects including missing data handling, statistical analysis, and geographic mapping of restaurant locations.<br>

## Key Tasks:<br>
**1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing**<br>
Identified the number of rows and columns in the dataset.<br>
Checked for missing values and applied appropriate methods to handle them.<br>
Converted data types where necessary to ensure consistency.<br>
Analyzed the distribution of the target variable ("Aggregate rating") and identified any class imbalances.<br>

**2. Descriptive Analysis**<br>
Calculated basic statistical measures (mean, median, standard deviation) for all numerical columns.<br>
Explored the distribution of categorical variables such as "Country Code", "City", and "Cuisines"<br>
Identified the top cuisines and cities with the highest number of restaurants.<br>

**3. Geospatial Analysis**<br>
Visualized restaurant locations on a map using latitude and longitude data.<br>
Analyzed the distribution of restaurants across different cities and countries.<br>
Explored the correlation between restaurant location and its rating, including visualizing this data on a map.<br>

## Tools & Libraries Used:<br>
***Pandas***: For data manipulation and preprocessing.<br>
***Matplotlib & Seaborn***: For statistical and categorical data visualization.<br>
***Folium***: For interactive geospatial visualization of restaurant locations.<br>
***NumPy***: For numerical computations.<br>

## Conclusion:<br>
This project demonstrates the end-to-end data analysis process, combining preprocessing, statistical analysis, and geospatial visualization to derive insights from the restaurant dataset.
